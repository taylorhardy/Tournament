Problem: You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write code to query
this data and determine the winners of various games.

Requirements: Python, PostgreSQL

Creating the database: Create a PostreSQL Database called 'Tournament' using 'psql tournament'. By doing this you will
enter the PostgreSQL CLI in the tournament database. Next use '\i tournament.sql' to create the tables and views that the
application will use.

To Run: To test the application you can use 'python tournament_test.py' and this will perform a series of registering players
performing matches and deleting players.
